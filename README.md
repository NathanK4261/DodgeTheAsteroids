# DodgeTheAsteroids

The official repository for Dodge The Asteroids!

This is a fun little game I decided to build as a way to learn about the pygame module and how it works. I thought it would just be annother project I'll trash in 1 month, 
but now its turned into a big project with its own DATABASE! 

To start, I was watching a tutorial on how to make a video game using python. After learning a bit about the language, I thought I was ready to start making video games,
so I started to watch the video. I realized I could take the code from the tutorial and repurpose it to work for my own original game which would be a lot more fun.

It took a while, but eventually the first version of the game was finished. And...It sucked!

I realized I only scratched the surface and I started to add a file system to save data when the game wasn't running. Later I added a database to sort out multiple scores
from across the world.

So the moral of the story, don't follow the tutorial :).

# Setup

Download this repository and run the 'install.sh' script in the directory where you want to install the game.
